AlphaFold is an AI system developed by Google DeepMind that predicts a protein's 3D structure from its amino acid sequence (Source 1, Source 8). It addresses the protein folding problem, a grand challenge in biology, with the latest version recognized by the Critical Assessment of protein Structure Prediction (CASP) (Source 2). AlphaFold has garnered wide media attention and is expected to have various benefits in life sciences, including accelerating drug discovery and improving the understanding of diseases (Source 4, Source 9).

Key points:

*   **Functionality:** Predicts 3D protein structures from amino acid sequences (Source 1, Source 8).
*   **Validation:** Predictions are validated using confidence scores (Source 1, Source 8).
*   **Impact:** Accelerates drug discovery, enhances disease understanding, and provides insights into protein structural dynamics and interactions (Source 4, Source 9, Source 12).
*   **Accessibility:** Freely available notebooks like AlphaFold or ColabFold can be used (Source 1, Source 8).
*   **Versions:** Recent versions such as AlphaFold 3, have expanded capabilities beyond proteins to include ligands, nucleic acids, and post-translational modifications (Source 11, Source 12).
*   **Limitations:** It may not be good at predicting disordered proteins and requires additional validation (Source 3, Source 13, Source 22).
*   **Applications:** Useful in identifying drug targets, understanding disease mechanisms, and designing new medications (Source 24).
