# AlphaFold Report

## Overview

AlphaFold, developed by DeepMind, is an AI system designed for protein structure prediction (Source 4, 12). It can predict 3D structures of proteins from their amino acid sequences with atomic-level accuracy (Source 11, 12). AlphaFold's architecture is detailed in the AlphaFold paper by Jumper et al., 2021 (Source 1).

## Key Features and Advancements

*   **Accurate Prediction:** AlphaFold can predict protein structures with accuracy comparable to experimental methods, even without relying on template structures (Source 1, 7, 22).
*   **Neural Network-Based Model:** AlphaFold utilizes a redesigned neural network-based model (Source 7).
*   **AlphaFold-latest:** AlphaFold-latest can predict structures of complexes, including non-protein elements like nucleic acids and small molecules (Source 9).
*   **AlphaFold 3:** AlphaFold 3 features a diffusion-based architecture capable of predicting the joint structure of complexes, including proteins, nucleic acids, small molecules, ions, and modified residues (Source 10).

## How AlphaFold Works

AlphaFold determines the complex interrelationships of a proteinâ€™s residues, which dictate the protein's structure (Source 3). It refines local structural details through iterations, similar to traditional refinement methods (Source 3). The system compares the sequence of the protein across a large database to generate a multiple sequence alignment (MSA) (Source 5).

## Applications

*   **Drug Discovery:** AlphaFold aids in identifying potential drug targets, understanding disease mechanisms, and designing new medications (Source 2, 14, 15).
*   **Structural Biology:** Useful for designing better protein expression experiments and solving experimental structures faster, especially for X-ray crystallography (Source 13).
*   **Biomolecular Insights:** AlphaFold-latest offers unprecedented precision in predicting protein structures, advancing biomolecular discovery and therapeutic developments (Source 9).
*   **General Research:** Accelerates scientific research across biology and life science (Source 11).

## Limitations

*   **Ligand Binding:** AlphaFold is not fully aware of molecules that bind to proteins, which can affect a protein's 3D structure (Source 16).
*   **Folding Process:** A perfect answer to protein prediction does not fully explain the protein folding process in nature (Source 2).
